    "# Classifying texts\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Bag-of-Words model\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier receives as input a vector of observations, which we will call $x$. This vector describes the content of an item of a dataset. The classifier uses $x$ to estimate a vector $y$ that represents the probability that the corresponding item belongs to each one of the $N$ known classes, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = y(x) = \\{P(C=c_n | x)\\} =\\{ P(C=c_1 | x), P(C=c_2 | x), \\cdots, P(C=c_N | x)\\} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: suppose we are trying to classify books into the categories \"romance\" and \"fantasy\". Then, we should somehow estimate a vector $x$ for each book in our collection (or: for each *item* in our *dataset*). After that, we have to find out some way to make a function that estimates $y$. Finally, each item in the dataset will be related to a vector of probabilities $y$. The components of $y$ can be interpreted as probabilities, e.g., $y=[0.2,0.8]$ means that the corresponding item has $20\\%$ probability of being from class 1 (in our case: romance) and $80\\%$ probability of being from class 2 (in our case: fantasy).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating statistics from data\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation we just saw assumes that $x$ is something we can measure from data. In many cases, measures are precise. For example, we can measure the age of a person without error. However, in most classification problems, our measures have many aspects we cannot account for. For example, it is very likely that mango trees have an expected height, but that expected value will not correspond exactly to any particular mango trees. Instead, we expect to see a distribution around it. It could be reasonable, in this case, to think about a Normal distribution with estimated mean and variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, in the case of texts, we should think about what is possible to measure and what is not possible to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we *can* measure very precisely is whether a particular text contains a particular word - we have done this several times, already!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can very precisely *count* how many documents in a collection contain a particular word.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, see, our classification problem concerns documents we have never seen before. This is a bit paradoxical: the best way to check if a book is \"romance\" or \"fiction\" is to have a full list of all \"romance\" and \"fiction\" books, and find our book there. However, the classification problem focuses in a situation in which we are looking at a new (never-seen-before) book. Perhaps we just wrote a book and want to know where to sell it? Perhaps we want to know if the book strongly fits one of these genres?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we cannot possibly have a catalogue including books that are yet to be written. So, we should make a model as to how a book in a particular genre behaves. This type of model is called a \"generative\" model (although nowadays the word \"generative\" is being used for other things as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a generative model, we assume that there is a probability distribution that generates new books from a particular genre. Hence, a particular book is a *sample* of that distribution. Now, we have to *estimate* the distribution parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to estimate the distribution *parameters*, we first have to choose its shape. To make this choice, we should look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The things we can measure\n",
    "1. What models make sense for it\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can measure if a particular book contains a particular word. If we assume that books from a genre are written independently, and that the words chosen in each book are independent from each other (these are naive assumptions...), then a book containing a word behaves very similarly to tossing a biased coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are talking about a [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of assuming a Bernoulli distribution is that we can import all the theory underlying it to our problem. Of course, the disadvantage of assuming anything is that we have made some concessions regarding how literature works, in special about the independence aspect. Thus, we will have the problem of finding out how much these assumptions have harmed our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before that, we should remember how the Bernoulli distribution works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution describes a process that has two outcomes (typically: heads and tails in a coin toss).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the phenomena below could be modelled using a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flipping a coin and recording whether it lands on heads (1) or tails (0). Y\n",
    "1. Rolling a die and recording whether the result is a 4. Y\n",

    "## Exercise 2: reviewsing the Bayes rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes Rule, or the Bayes Theorem, regards the idea of inverting conditionals. A conditional probability is a probability calculated under the assumption of something being known. We write it as $P(A|B)$, which is read: \"probability of $A$ given $B$\". In real life, we live situations like that all the time. For example, there is a probability that any day, picked at random, is rainy. However, if we pick any day in which we know everyone is using umbrellas, then the probability of picking a rainy day is different, that is, $P(\\text{rain}) \\neq P(\\text{rain} | \\text{everyone is using umbrellas})$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We can use the diagram above to calculate the probability of $A$ given $B$. In this case, we need to compute all favorable and possible events (which is $A \\cap B$, because we *know* $B$ happens) and divide by all possible events (which is $B$, as we *know* $B$ happens). Hence, the conditional can be written as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n",

    "So far, we have been using the `CountVectorizer` for our classification. It essentially gives us the Term Frequency (TF) for each word in each document. Hence, it gives us an idea of the importance of each term for each document.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use a TFIDF vectorizer to replace the `CountVectorizer`. For such, simply change the CountVectorizer to a `TfidfVectorizer` in our usual pipeline (don't forget to import the library - check the documentation above if you need more help!).\n",
