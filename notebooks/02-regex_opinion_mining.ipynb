    "If everything went well, you should be seeing \"say\" and \"says\" with high document frequencies. However, they carry very similar information - hence they should be together.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to deal with that is to remember that words are composed of a stem and a suffix (like \"liquid\", \"liquidification\", \"liquidize\", and so on). The process of removing the suffix is called \"stemming\". There are some interesting processes to perform stemming.\n",
